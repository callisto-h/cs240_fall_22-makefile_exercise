Practice exercise for writing makefiles and compiling multi-file C++ programs.

Some hints for what to look out for:

1. Not including all .o files in makefile linking line
2. Compiling .h files instead of using #include
3. #including .cpp files AND also compiling them separately
4. Wrapping the member function implementations with "class Player { ... } "
5. Excluding makefile dependancies
